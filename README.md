## `/scikit-learn/.github`

Default organizational-level community health files for all repos in the scikit-learn organization. They will be used by GitHub for all repos, unless there is a file with the same name (e.g. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in the repository. Local repository health files supercede the files in this repository.

See [About default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization) for more details.
